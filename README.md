# lensfocus

### A grafic interface to quickly test how different lens models focus observed images in the source plane.

At some point I would like to add:
- proper visualisation of the critical curves (if fast enough)
- more mass models
- input/output .yaml files with the lens parameters and image positions
- better contrast control for .fits files
- improve user interface
